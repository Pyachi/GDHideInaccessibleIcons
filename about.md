# Hide 2.21 Icons

Don't you just hate when you look into how to unlock an icon and all you get is "Too bad, wait for 2.21"?
This is the mod for you! 
Get rid of those pesky icons that just tease you with their awesome designs and yet are impossible to obtain.

## TODO

- Reduce page count to match new icon count.
- Figure out how to check for unlock conditions without expensive internal calls every time.
